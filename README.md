# Appointment App

Welcome to my Appointment App! This project was created using **Angular** and **Bootstrap**, leveraging Angular version 16. Using this version allowed me to avoid using standalone components, which streamlined the development process.

## Features

- **Local Storage**: Integrated local storage to save user data, providing a seamless experience by retaining information even after the browser is closed.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Utilized Bootstrap to ensure the app is fully mobile responsive, offering an optimal experience across different devices.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in several key areas:

- **ngFor**: Implemented *ngFor* to efficiently loop through data and display it within the app.
- **One-way and Two-way Binding**: Explored both one-way and two-way data binding techniques to handle dynamic data and user input effectively.
- **Method Binding**: Learned how to bind methods to HTML button clicks, enhancing the app's interactivity and functionality.

## Next Steps

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I am excited to scale up from here. My future plans include developing larger-scale projects and potentially incorporating a backend to further enhance the functionality of my applications.
